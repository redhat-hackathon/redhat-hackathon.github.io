**We are halfway through the Red Hat ReBoot CX - EMEA challenge!** Submissions are due October 31st before 13:00 CET.

### Start your submission now

[Starting a submission](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021748772-How-to-enter-a-submission) is a good way to make sure that your app meets the [requirements]((https://redhat.devpost.com/)). There’s nothing worse than getting to the deadline, only to realize that you’re missing a key component. **Remember:** once you submit a project, you can keep editing it as needed at **any time prior to the submission deadline**.

### Prepare your video

We know as devs you’re expertise lies in building the software - so keep building! - however, the submission video needs time too! It's often the first (and sometimes only!) thing that judges review.

Your [video](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021816952-Video-making-best-practices) tells the story behind your submission, providing a clear to showcase your software and talent in a video: 

 - Establish your elevator pitch. In the first few seconds of your video, explain how your software solution uses Red Hat technology and how you ReBoot customer experience with open source!
 - Within 60 seconds, viewers tend to lose interest, so use this time wisely to keep them engaged!
 - Show, don't tell. Providing real life context and showing users firsthand how you're going to improve customer services through your solution will help judges understand and appreciate your product design.
 - Keep it simple. Per the official rules, your video shouldn't be longer than five minutes.
 - **Don't wait until the last minute to upload your video**. Due to file size, format, and your Internet connection, uploading a video to YouTube, Vimeo, or Youku could take anywhere from a few minutes to several hours.
 - Get organized. Write out a script of what you’ll say and demonstrate in your video and rehearse it before recording.  Essentially a good script should talk about:
     - The problem that your potential customers face.
     - Existing solutions to the problem.
     - The solution that your software provides.
     - How the software provides it.
