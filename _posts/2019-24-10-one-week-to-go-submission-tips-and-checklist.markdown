**You’re almost there!**  There is just one week left to submit your software to the Red Hat ReBoot CX - EMEA.


**Submissions are due October 31st before 13:00 CET.** ([Find out what time that is in your city](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Red+Hat+ReBoot+CX+-+EMEA&iso=20191031T13&p1=14))
 
If you haven't started a submission yet, please **do so now**. (We’ll walk you through our [submission form process](https://help.devpost.com/hc/en-us/articles/360021748772-How-to-enter-a-submission) if you need help.)  And if you've just recently joined the hackathon, be sure to familiarize yourself with the [official rules](https://redhat.devpost.com/rules), review the requirements and check out the to-do’s listed to help get you started.

### Submission checklist

Run through this list before you sit back from your project:

 - Have you built an app that uses at least two Red Hat technologies?
 - Does your software enhance a customer service experience?
 - Have you created a [submission video](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/how-to-make-a-good-video/)? Does your video clearly demonstrate how your software works? Is it no more than three minutes long? (Check out these [tips for making a great submission video](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/how-to-make-a-good-video/).)

Be sure to read through the [official rules](https://redhat.devpost.com/rules) more than once. Or better yet, have a friend or colleague provide a second pair of eyes to make sure you did not miss anything.

**Good luck!**
