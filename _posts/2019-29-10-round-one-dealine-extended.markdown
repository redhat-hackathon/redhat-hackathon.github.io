We are giving you one more weekend to finish up, package and polish your submission! 

#### The new deadline for Round One submissions is Monday, November 4, 13:00 CET.

All other deadlines will remain the same. 

If you are a procrastinator - you probably just breathed a sigh of relief.  For those of you who are almost finished, you can submit this week, and enjoy your weekend! 

You can still ask your questions on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rebootredhat/shared_invite/enQtNzQ4MzAyODAyMDAwLTc2YzI3MWVjOTg4ZjkxMTE4NzkzMTRhMmU4NWY4YmUxNWMxMjk3OTQ1YWNlZWZmNmE3M2M2MWUyZDY2ZDBmMzI).
