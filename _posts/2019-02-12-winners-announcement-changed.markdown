Hi Everyone!

**We'll be announcing the winners of the Red Hat Hackathon during a webinar on Thursday, December 12 at 19:00 CET (7pm).**

Due to some internal logistic challenges we have postponed the announcement by one week. We apologize for any inconvenience or any additional jitters for our final submitters.  

**Here is the URL for the Winner announcement webinar:**

We hope you can all attend the announcement as we'll hear from Red Hat, our judges and the winners too (although they don't know that yet!).
