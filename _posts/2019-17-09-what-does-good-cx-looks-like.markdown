As a continuation of our blog post: [What do we mean by CX (Customer Experience) and how can we improve it](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/what-do-we-mean-by-cs-and-how-can-we-improve-it/), we are going to analyze a couple of use cases and their implications in coming up with a good CX (Customer Experience) and give you a few tips to get started on your idea..

But before we begin this quick journey, we need to refresh a couple of concepts. Let's get started. 

### What is CX (Customer Experience)?

Customer experience (CX) "is the product of an interaction between an organization and a customer over the duration of their relationship."

In a nutshell, the above concept refers to how a customer perceives the brand through all the interactions across the customer life cycle. 

In this interaction/customer life cycle, there are 3 main components: 

 - The customer journey.
 - The contact points between the brand and the customer, where the interaction happens. 
 - The context and environment that the customer experiences during this interaction. 

A good CX means that the customer experience during all these mentioned points of contact matches (or better yet, exceeds!) the expectations.

As a developer, your job is to design and develop the way those intended experiences are delivered. 

### CX Disruption

By keeping in mind our above definition, there are companies/brands that disrupted CX, they were game changers in their respective product areas:

 - **Netflix:** they changed in part the film industry and the way most people watch movies and TV shows. One part of its core strategy is to understand that personalization is the key to offering customers an experience that keeps them engaged.

 - **Spotify:** they knew that music is the great connector. It unites us across markets, ages, backgrounds, languages, preferences, political leanings and income levels. They leveraged this knowledge and offered a great music streaming experience: they were pioneers in the field. 

And the list continues: **Uber**, **Transferwise**, **Stripe**, **AirBnb**... All these companies/brands have revolutionized the industry with innovative, creative and disrupted ideas. 

### Getting Started on your Idea

There are two ways to get started with your hackathon idea:

 1. Think of a service you interact with daily or weekly (a bank, medical care, education service, transportation, retail).  Is there something that frustrates you? How did you find out about them?  Was there any followup?
 2. Perhaps you are working for a company.  Think about the ways your customer interacts with your company from the moment they learn about you. Better yet, if you have the data to back up the customer journey, use that. Are there gaps or continual problem areas with the service?

**Then review:  Whatâ€™s the most important part of the service to ensure the customer gets what they need?**

Next step is to put your creative developer hat on in whatever way that works for you (using a whiteboard, taking your dog for a walk, have a beer!).  How would YOU devise a better service experience? Turn it around, look at it from a different angle. Is there a new technology that can support your delivery such as machine learning and data science or even XR (virtual reality or augmented reality)!  You might see an entirely new way to offer that service and become the next disruptor!
