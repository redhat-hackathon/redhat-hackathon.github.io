### What is the Red Hat Summit?

As you probably know, one of our [top prizes](https://redhat.devpost.com/rules) of our hackathon is the invitation to attend and present the winning project at our [Red Hat Summit](https://www.redhat.com/en/summit) in 2020 in San Francisco. 

**But what is this Red Hat Summit all about?**

**Put simply:** It is a huge event celebrating the power of open source. It is Red Hat driven but open to any other companies and contributors in the space. It is an annual, three day event alternating between San Francisco and Boston. 

This year, we’ll hold it in San Francisco between **April 27 to 29, 2020**. We have most of our customers and partners there.

**Red Hat Summit** is the premier open source technology event for thousands of IT professionals to innovate and focus on high-performing Linux, cloud, automation and management, container, and Kubernetes technologies. 

In 2020, we expect over 9,000 attendees, over 2000 companies, a gigantic exhibition area, 300 hours of content delivered by 35 expert speakers in a 3 day conference. 

#### So here is what’s in it for you -- well, if you win:

**We’ll invite the winners to attend the Summit**. This means we get you passes, flights and hotel. You can enjoy and consume all the various events, exhibition, talks and content. You will also get the chance to present your winning project at Summit. 

Finally, it is a great opportunity to mingle with experts, network and learn. This is huge for whatever you are after: **building a business, acquiring knowledge, collecting valuable contacts, or getting a job**.
