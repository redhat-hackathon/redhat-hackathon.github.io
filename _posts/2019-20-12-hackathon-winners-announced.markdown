Back in September we launched the Red Hat EMEA Hackathon inviting developers to “ReBoot Customer Experience with Open Source.” We did this as part of a drive to encourage greater developer adoption, for more on why we are running a campaign like the Hackathon, read our previous [blog post](https://mojo.redhat.com/groups/emea-internal-communications/blog/2019/09/20/red-hat-emea-hackathon-how-we-aim-to-improve-developer-adoption-via-a-large-scale-emea-virtual-hackathon).

Hundreds of developers from around the world participated, some as individuals with others as part of a team, helping to create some fantastic app ideas. The submissions were reviewed by an experienced panel of six judges - whom I should thank for all their hard work and words of wisdom.

**Thank you!**
 - **Gert Jan van Halem**, Chief Technology Officer at Devoteam
 - **Markus Eisele**, Developer Adoption Program Lead, Red Hat Germany
 - **Markus Heimbach**, Director of Engineering at Dynatrace
 - **Jose Quaresma**, DevOps practice Leader at Accenture
 - **Antonio Valle Gutierrez**, Global Head of BPM & BRMS Architecture, BBVA

You can find out more about our judges [here](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/judging-criteria-who-are-our-judges/).

In mid-December we announced the winners, and in reverse order here they are:

In **third place** was **Victor CX**, an auditory CUI for visually impaired or differently-abled users for building inclusive interfaces that access and manage an organization's technology products and online services, which was developed by an individual contributor, Allister Beharry, who walks away with a cash prize of €3000.

In **second place** and winner of a €5000 cash prize was **rhv2prometheus**, an app which can build metrics from the ovirt-engine api from RHV and present them as prometheus format, then can be scraped from an openshift prometheus to integrate fully infrastructure monitoring, which was created in Spain by Xana Da Silva Mori, Michael Ramirez, Mario Parra de Miguel and Victor Parraga.

In **first place** was the **ACE**: Airline Customer Experience, a system developed to take the pain and waiting time out of app development at airlines where it can take up to nine months to make changes to systems that impact customer experience, often because they are monolithic mainframe applications. Phil Ogilvie, Andre McGuire, RH Carboleo, Mizanur Rahman, Daniel Weatherhead, will have free flights, accommodation and attendance at Red Hat Summit 2020 in San Francisco, in addition to sharing the top prize of €10,000.

In addition to all the participants and judges, **I also want to say a huge thank you to everyone at Red Hat who made the competition possible**. As a campaign to raise awareness and drive up developer adoption, the Hackathon was a great success that really helped shine a light on the agility that open source technology enables for creative and innovative developers.
