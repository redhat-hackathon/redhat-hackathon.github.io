title:  "What is good code?"

In a [hackathon](https://redhat.devpost.com/?utm_source=redhat&utm_medium=OrganicSocial&utm_content=developers&utm_campaign=redhatrebootcx), when it comes to programming, most of the time, the idea is to learn and have fun, compromising code quality and readability. 

However, as we evolve as **Software Engineers** the quality of the code we write gets more important, making easier to build systems that are:

 - **Scalable**.
 - **Modular**.
 - **Testable**.
 - **Independent of frameworks, UI and Databases**.

### How to measure code quality?

This could be summarized as the number of WTFs per minute when trying to understand/read source code:

### What is in the end good code?

High quality code in general terms, can be translated to source code that:
 
 - **Is covered by tests** (a good practice would be to be aligned with the [Test Pyramid](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html)). 
 - **Respect SOLID principles** (if you come from a Functional Programm there are [equivalent principles](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/165356/equivalent-of-solid-principles-for-functional-programming) too).
 - **Follow Engineering Design Patterns** ([Patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns) are proben solutions to recurring problems).
 - **Use Programming Languages Format and Naming Conventions**.
 - **Has a good Design and Architecture** (Simple and easy to understand).

### Webinars and Documention to the rescue

In order to facilite developers life, we have published a bunch of webinars [here](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/update-upcoming-webinar-the-red-hat-open-source-stack/), [here](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/update-upcoming-webinar-how-to-protect-a-rest-api-using-3scale/) and [here](https://redhat-hackathon.github.io/blog/update-upcoming-webinars/), which can help you achieve all the mentioned points. 

Also you can find [extra documentation](https://redhat.devpost.com/details/resources) for every specific Red Hat technology. 

### Wrapping up
**Writing production-ready code is not easy**, it requires time and effort which could be key in a hackathon, but keep also in mind that it can give you a couple of extra points.
