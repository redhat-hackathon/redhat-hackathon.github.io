title:  "What’s the Red Hat Managed Platform for AppDev and benefits does it deliver?"

For our hackathon we provide a Red Hat Managed Platform for application development (AppDev) on which all our middleware tools are deployed. Red Hat is the open source company. All of our technologies, tools and platforms are fully open source. 

The managed platform for AppDev is based on two products for which Red Hat sells support:

 1. [Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated](https://www.openshift.com/products/dedicated/) Container Platform (OSD).
 2. Red Hat Managed [Integration](https://www.redhat.com/en/products/integration) (RHMI).

Red Hat OpenShift is an open, hybrid cloud Kubernetes platform to build, run, and scale container-based applications. OpenShift includes everything you need to manage your development lifecycle, including standardized workflows, support for multiple environments, continuous integration, and release management. OpenShift Dedicated (OSD) is a specific variant of this product, which Red Hat hosts and manages.

Red Hat also has a very successful offer of integration technologies, which we refer to as “Agile Integration.” Our Agile Integration story has impressed customers, partners and analysts. Because of that, we decided to offer the entire Red Hat Agile Integration stack, as well as development tools like Codeready Workspaces as a managed service: Red Hat Managed Integration (RHMI). RHMI is deployed on top of the OpenShift Dedicated Container Platform (OSD). We leverage RHMI for our hackathon based on the same principle and not only offer integration tools but the complete stack of middleware tools by Red Hat.  

With Red Hat Managed Integration we help our customers and partners reduce operational risk, cost, and time to market of building enterprise applications. The value of Red Hat Managed Integration can be summed up as follows:

Technically, the official Red Hat Managed Integration offer has three layers. At its core, RHMI has the Agile Integration technology that has been available from Red Hat as a self managed option. Red Hat’s unique approach to integration allows development teams to bring new and updated functionality rapidly to market. Red Hat Agile Integration frees organisations of the inefficiencies of creating monolithic applications with a microservices-based approach to integration.

RHMI hosts the Agile Integration technology on Red Hat OpenShift Dedicated, which we described above. Leveraging OpenShift Dedicated allows users to create and deploy microservices easily. Developers can concentrate on development rather than hosting containers. 

Finally, leveraging Red Hat’s experience in enterprise integration, RHMI includes a visual solution explorer as a third layer to browse and make use of the various tools in a streamlined way.

In our next blog we’ll provide you with some practical information on how to use the platform for the ReBoot CX hackathon.
