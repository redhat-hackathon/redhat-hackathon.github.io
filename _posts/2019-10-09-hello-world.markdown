This GitHub page will host our official hack blog.

The theme of our hackathon is Customer Experience (CX). We want to see how you will reinvent or “Reboot” CX with open source technologies provided by Red Hat. 
 
The official Hackathon site is hosted at [https://redhat.devpost.com/](https://redhat.devpost.com/), where you will find the rules, eligibility and submission requirements.  And of course, information about judging and prizes can be found there too!
 
### Getting Started

To find out how to Get Started and learn more about Red Hat tools – head to the [Resources page](https://redhat.devpost.com/details/resources) on the hackathon site.
 
Each team will get access to our managed development platform called AppDev which is based on the Open Shift container platform and requires using a Red Hat application runtime. 
 
To be eligible for a prize, each submission must also use one of these Red Hat middleware tools:
1. Red Hat Fuse for integration
2. Red Hat AMQ for real time messaging
3. Red Hat 3scale API management
4. Red Hat Process Automation Manager
5. Red Hat Decision Manager
6. Red Hat DataGrid for distributed caching
7. Red Hat Single Sign-on (SSO)
 
### Rounds and Submissions

Important to note – the hackathon has two rounds of submissions and judging. 

**Round One submissions close on October 31st.**
 
Only 15 teams will move on to Round Two and get an extra week to polish their submissions before the final judging takes place. Winners will be announced at viewing parties on December 5, 2019.
 
### Slack for Teams and Discussions

If you need to find a teammate, or have questions about the tools you can do this through DevPost site, as well as posting to our hackathon [Slack site](https://app.slack.com/client/TN1KCSREJ/CMZE59VUM).
  
Check back for information on the hackathon, updates and some inspiration for your projects.
Good luck.  We can’t wait to see what you will create.
